# One Man's Guide to Spending a Summer or Gap Year Abroad

This site is meant to be a guide for people wishing to travel abroad, be it to study, learn a language, immerse yourself in a culture, or simply for the love of exploration and adventure.


My name is John. After I finished High School, I decided to take a year off before starting starting college in order to travel and hopefully improve my limited Spanish. When I actually went about making that happen, I found a severe lack of up-to-date information about what options one might have for living abroad. What information I did find seemed highly anecdotal or heavily biased. Through a hodgepodge of errors, I managed to spend three months in Spain as an Au Pair (more on that later) while taking spanish classes. This site is a collection of the things I have learned, put together in the hope that it may be of help to people who started out as confused as I did.

The knowledge on this site is solely from my own perspective, though in an effort to display a wider range of possibilities, I have talked to a number of friends to include information about paths for international travel that I didnâ€™t pursue. I encourage you keep in mind the limited perspective this site represents, and to verify any information you can for yourself. I encourage you to do the same for information you find anywhere else.
